1) Write a program, in which user is asked to choice from 0 to 2 for different tasks. . 
Choosing 0, will execute a function that would add 2 numbers. Choosing 1, will execute a function 
that would subtract 2 numbers, Choosing 2, will execute a function that would multiply 2 numbers.
In this program instead os use of switch case, use function pointers.

2) Make a structure and initialise its data variables by creating the object of the structure via pointers. 
Create a 1-D array of this structure of index 2. And then print the values of data variables of the structure.


3) Create the most optimized struct, which takes in command id, source, and acts as service parser for 3 commands.
    Command  Id 1: Get key info 
        Components: key length (32 bit number), key type (hexadecimal value for 8 bits), isprivate (have binary value)
    Command Id 2: Get Current Status
        Components: essential_core (binary value), core number (8 bit hexadecimal number)
    Command Id 3: Suspend Application 
          Components: application id (16 bit number), application type (4 bit number), priority (8 bit value)
    At a given time only one command can be executed and values of rest command components must be NULL.
    Also for each command it is necessary to fill all details.
