1) Write a program, in which user is asked to choice from 0 to 2 for different tasks. . Choosing 0, will execute a function that would add 2 numbers. Choosing 1, will execute a function 
that would subtract 2 numbers, Choosing 2, will execute a function that would multiply 2 numbers. You have to make this program using function pointer.
2) Make a structure and initialise its data variables by creating the object of the structure via pointers. Create a 1-D array of this structure of index 2. And then print 
the values of data variables of the structure.
3) Make a structure, of int, char, string and union.In union, we have one integer array and character array of 50 index each. Process this function by creating its object via pointers.
You have to pass the strcuture object to the functions for processing it. For Processing, you have to initialise and print the structure
