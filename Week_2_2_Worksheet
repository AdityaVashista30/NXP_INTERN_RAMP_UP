Q1. Suppose there is a school with 10 sections (A,B,C,â€¦.,I,J). The sections which are vowels have 25 students, 
sections following each vowel have 20 students, sections preceding a vowel have 30 students and all rest sections have 22 students.
Create a single database for all students in school having their marks in 5 subjects (out of 100) as well as section and roll number.

Q2. Once database is created
 	a. print top 5 students of each section based on %
	b. print top 10 students in all sections based on %
	c. print top 20 students in each individual subject in all sections

Q3. After this shuffle all the students based on merit  according to division of sections described in Q1. i.e. all the top 25 students should be in section A, 
next 20 students in section B, and so on. In this new database, topper will be given roll number 1 in section A, and rest as follows.  
Also store the roll number and class the student was previously in.
